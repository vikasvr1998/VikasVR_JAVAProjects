    /*    Usually we have 2 types of hiding in oops i.e.
         1.Hiding the data members / Hiding within the class which is nothing but Encapsulation
         2.Hiding the core functionality known as Abstract (keyword)
         Simple example for this is
         Suppose we have car() function i.e. car() c=new car(); c.drive()
         Now while driving I am not at all worried about how engine works , how is fuel supplied to engine
         how gear transmission occurs etc. all these things will be done by engineers . I am just doing driving
         that's it !!! I need not worry about all these things .

         Also, Abstraction can also be said like hiding all unnecessary details and showing only important
         details to user.

         With abstract concept you can hide full class, or you can even hide the methods

         Showing only the essential features of an object to the user : Abstract principle

         Hiding the inner details in order to reduce the complexity

         This can be implemented by 2 keywords
         1. abstract
         2. interface
