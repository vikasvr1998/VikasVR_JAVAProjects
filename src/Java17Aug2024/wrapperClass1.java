    /* A Wrapper class is a class whose object wraps or contains primitive data types
       - They convert primitive data types into objects
       - Now why are we learning this ?
       - Because next we are going to learn collections which tells us how to make use of java in more efficient
         manner like storing an advanced data i.e. lists , sets , key value pair and in these cases we need objects,
         and we cannot not use primitive data types .
       - When you are working with advanced data structures , primitive data types are not supported

       In API & Web Automation - > We don't use primitive data types (Which is just used for core java projects)
       We use Classes and Objects --> Where we use wrapper class !!!!
