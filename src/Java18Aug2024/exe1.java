    /* Different ways to handle the Exceptions (Both of them are used to handle the exceptions )

      If you want to save a piece of code , Go for this ....

         1. Try & Catch Methods (Handles only the vulnerable piece of code )
            a. Try and Single Catch
            b. Try and Multiple Catch
            c. Try , Catch and Finally->(Block of code will be executed anyway )

     If you want to save full function , Go for this ....

        2 . Throws (Handles full functions that is vulnerable)
            Works on full method

     We have one more exception known as Custom Exception i.e. throw keyword which is used to create an exception,
     and it is also supported with try and catch block which is further used to handle the exception
