    /*    This concept helps us in handling the large and complex data's

     Draw Backs of Arrays :
     Suppose     Integer[] i=new Integer[10];

      1. Here Size is Fixed , further we may need to some extra memory based on applications
      2. Can we sort Directly ? No
      3. No Built-in functions , thereby decrease in efficiency .
      4. Sorting , Deleting , adding nothing can be done !
      5. Unused Memory results in Memory Wastage
      6. Array can store only one type of data_type

      To solve all these issues we have ARRAY LIST !!!!
